Backlog:
- Baked shadow maps for static lights?
- Remove all STL usage
- Load opengl extensions manually - Ditch GLEW https://apoorvaj.io/loading-opengl-without-glew/
- Ditch SDL and implement windows, input, file io myself
- Map Editor:
  - console command 'editor' to enter
  - quits the game inside the gamemode, and simply loads the map into the editor (keep camera in same transformation)
  - use console to load and save
    - 'save folder/path/name.map'
    - 'load folder/path/name.map' load automatically saves current map
    - maybe keep loaded maps in memory? until we explicitly call unload? or there are too many maps loaded?
      - so that we can switch between maps without losing the map data in memory
        - then we can have a "palette" map with a collection of loaded model objs that we can copy instead of finding on disk
    - use console commands to create geometry?
  - texture blending - store the bitmap in memory, and we can write it to map data or an actual bitmap whatever
    - brush system like in unity/unreal where you paint textures, and behind the scenes we can edit the blend map in memory
- GJK EPA collision system
- Arrow rendering for debugging
  - in the future arrow can also be used for translation gizmo
- add SIMD for kc_math library
- Fixed timestep? for physics only?
- texture_t GL_NEAREST option
- texture_t do something like source engine
  - Build simple polygons and shapes, and the textures get wrapped
  automatically(1 unit in vertices is 1 unit in texture uv)
- Console:
  - MESSAGE TYPES: Regular, Warning, Error
  - option for some console messages to be displayed to game screen.
  - remember previously entered commands
  - shader hotloading/compiling during runtime - pause all update_scene / render while shaders are being recompiled
  - mouse picking entities
