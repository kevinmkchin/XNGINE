# opengl-3d-renderer (WORK IN PROGRESS)
3D graphics render engine using OpenGL in mostly C with some C++

![sponza atrium no shadows](https://i.imgur.com/rghBOau.jpg)

[GLEW](http://glew.sourceforge.net/) for OpenGL interface.
[SDL](https://www.libsdl.org/) for window creation and input.
[Open Asset Importer](https://www.assimp.org/) for importing 3D models.

I create a backup of the project at every new feature/implementation to keep a record of the code and executable as the project progresses. They would also be useful references when starting a new OpenGL project.

## How to Build and Run
### Windows
- Run build-win64-msvc.bat or build-win64-cmake.bat (msvc build requires 64 bit msvc compiler)
- Run run.bat (with argument "vs" if you want to launch Visual Studio to debug)
- Profit
