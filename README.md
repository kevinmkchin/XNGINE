# opengl-3d-renderer
3D graphics render engine using OpenGL in mostly C with some C++

[GLEW](http://glew.sourceforge.net/) for interfacing with OpenGL.
[SDL](https://www.libsdl.org/) for window creation and OpenGL Context. 

I create a backup of the project at every new feature/implementation to keep a record of the code and executable as the project progresses. They would also be useful references when starting a new OpenGL project.

## How to Build and Run
### Windows
- Run build-win64-msvc.bat (msvc build requires 64 bit msvc compiler)
- Run run.bat (with argument "vs" if you want to launch Visual Studio to debug)
- Either set the working directory of the executable to be /data or move the contents of /data to where the executable is located
- Profit
